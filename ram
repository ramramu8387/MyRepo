Martinez in Game Three, two more home runs in Game Five in Cleveland, and number six, appropriately enough, in Game Six. All of them you hit in the four games Cleveland won. Four other hits, errorless defense. It was the best week you ever had in the major leagues, as good a week as anyone could have. I suppose others have asked you this too, but, why? Why that week? 

RYAN: I… I mean, it’s harder to say than you might think.

	CAROLYN: You were seeing the ball well?

	RYAN: (Takes a sip of water from a glass on the table next to him.) Sure. That’s what guys always say when they’re hot, but, it’s just a cliché guys say when they can’t explain a fluke. Hot streaks are flukes. Slumps are flukes too, until you get a bit too old and then they’re the new normal. But that week, I had same eyes I always had. If I had some secret I could unlock at will, I’d have used it my whole career. But, you know, sometimes guys throw you bad pitches. Maybe I just got a lot of bad pitches that week.
